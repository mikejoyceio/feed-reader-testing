#Feed Reader Testing

######Project Overview

Project #6 of Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The task was to learn about TDD (test-driven development) by piecing together an incomplete Jasmine test suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

######Getting Started

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to your local machine.

2. Open index.html in your browser.

######Additional Tests

An additional test suite has been added and contains specs to ensure a loading animation is visible when a feed is being loaded and hidden either when the feed loads successfully or if there is an error in the AJAX request.

Detailed code comments on what the individual specs are testing for can be found in within the 'Loading Animation' describe function on line 261 of feedreader.js.
